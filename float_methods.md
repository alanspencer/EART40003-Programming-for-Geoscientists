There are very few useful methods attached to float (and even fewer on bool or int). Only one is listed here. 

Methods for float (built-in string class)
======================

This is a method not a function, so the syntax uses the ‘.’ after an object of type float. For example, use `variable.is_integer()` not `is_integer(variable)`.

**is_integer() return type: bool**
<br />Returns True if the float value is a precise integer value, i.e. will return True on 2.0 but False on 2.1
